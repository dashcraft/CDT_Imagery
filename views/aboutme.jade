			p <strong>CDT Imagery</strong> was created upon the idea that beauty is only what the creator makes it out to be and since life is full of moments to capture, I want to be the one that creates the perfect visual for you guys to enjoy for a lifetime. If you are looking for an easy going, refined, yet comforting time to retain what’s most important to you, you’ve finally found it!<br><br>My name is <strong>Cynthia Tran</strong> and I’m a travel photographer and muse based in Oklahoma City, specializing in fine arts, portraiture, wedding and scenic photography. I’ve been photographing for almost seven years, never asking to fall in love with such an expensive hobby that consistently makes me feel like a constant work in progress, yet loving the gratification that comes with seeing improvements and changes in pace that comes with it. With that being said, I’m the kind of girl that’s always up for a challenge. I am a mother to a beautiful boy and he’s motivated much of the effort I give to excel at everything I do. Apart from loving my time behind the camera, I’ve also experienced what it’s like to model and have learned so much in the past three years creatively directing a shoot that way; it’s made me inevitably grow more passion and excitement for what I do.<br><br>My <strong>work</strong> expands throughout the west and east coast as I make adventures and exploring my number one priority. I believe that a person can gain so much knowledge, wisdom, love, and understanding from the experiences they have so I keep plenty in hand. I take pride in being mutable and versatile with my environment since I started shooting only outdoors six years ago and now made my way into the studio environment, as well. A lot of my inspiration comes from the people I’ve witnessed creating amazing things, as well as nature and the way she offers endless beauty. To go out and see all the things life has to offer, inspires me to share that token with you guys, so you can feel what I feel when you see the images.<br><br>Besides that, I’m simply a <strong>person</strong> that truly enjoys meeting new people and going new places, in which I found all of those things when I picked up my camera and did my first shoot. This is provided to share with you all the world as I see it.<br><br>For <strong>questions and comments</strong>, refer to the contact link in the side bar. Enjoy!
